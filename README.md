# MaxEnt
Maximization of Entropy

This is the main file of the algorithm presented in the paper
"Inverting Monotonic Nonlinearities by Entropy Maximization".
You can play with it by generating some PNL mixtures and invert the
nonlinear distortion through MaxEnt, Gaussianization and Uniformization
algorithms.

How it works:
1) choose a nonlinear distortion by uncommenting lines 69-71 or 73-75
2) choose an algorithm by uncommenting lines 79-80 or 82-83
 
You can play with the order of the polynomes (N), the length of the
signals (T), the matrix (A), etc. Other parameters can be tunned into the
corresponding functions.
