Maximization of Entropy

This is the main file of the algorithm presented in the paper
Solé-Casals J, López-de-Ipiña Pena K, Caiafa CF (2016) Inverting Monotonic Nonlinearities by Entropy Maximization. PLoS ONE 11(10): e0165288. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165288

You can play with it by generating some PNL mixtures and invert the
nonlinear distortion through MaxEnt, Gaussianization and Uniformization
algorithms.

How it works:
1) choose a nonlinear distortion by uncommenting lines 69-71 or 73-75
2) choose an algorithm by uncommenting lines 79-80 or 82-83
 
You can play with the order of the polynomes (N), the length of the
signals (T), the matrix (A), etc. Other parameters can be tunned into the
corresponding functions.
